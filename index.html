            <p> I'm a big advocate for staying fit, so going to the gym or just working out, is a big passion
              for me. And i suggest you do the same! We can't only go by sitting in our chair coding all day.

          <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p> Coding has become a recent big interest for me, before it was very alien, since i had never coded in my life.
              But now i'm completely hooked and i'm always looking for new projects to work on.

          <h2>Computer Science</h2>
            <p> The thing is, being a programmer is not only about writing code, it's also about understanding the
              concepts behind it. And that's why i'm always looking for new ways to learn more about computer science.
              Data structures, algorithms, math, you name it.

                    I moved to Sofia to study. It was hard moving to a completely new place at the age of 19, far away from family and friends, but I adapted quickly, but these days i'm completely used to it and i feel great! <br><br>
                    I originally come from a language highschool and I started my journey with programming without any prior experience, in my first year in university. But i have been working hard to catch up to my peers. <br><br>
                    The benefit of my highschool is that now i speak two foreign languages, English at C2 level - fluently and German at B2/C1 - profficently. <br><br> 
                    I'm currently looking for an internship in the field of web or software development. I'm a fast learner and I'm always eager to learn new things. I'm a hard worker and I'm
                    always willing to put in the extra effort to get the job done. I'm a team player and I'm always willing to help my teammates.</li>

                it was just a proof-of-concept, it uses ready-made libraries and is 90% copied code. I had 0 knowledge of python before that.</p>
